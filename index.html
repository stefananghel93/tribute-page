          <h3>Here's a time line of Ken Miles life:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>1918</strong> - Born in Sutton Coldfield, United Kingdom</li>
            <li><strong>1933</strong> - left school at the age of 15 to work as an apprentice at Wolseley Motors </li>
            <li><strong>1942</strong> - he was among the founding members of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers</li>
            <li><strong>1944</strong> - served in North West Europe until the end of the WW2 </li>
            <li><strong>1946</strong> - He was discharged to the reserves</li>
            <li><strong>1952</strong> - Miles moved from England to the US, and settled in Los Angeles, California as a service manager for Gough Industries, the Southern California MG distributor</li>
            <li><strong>1953</strong> - he won 14 straight victories in SCCA racing in an MG-based special of his own design and construction.</li>
            <li> <strong>1955</strong> - he designed, constructed and campaigned a second special based on MG components that was known as the "Flying Shingle"</li>
            <li><strong>1957</strong> - Miles engineered the installation of a Porsche 550S engine and transmission in a 1956 Cooper chassis and body. It was the second successful race car to be known on the West Coast as "the Pooper"</li>
            <li><strong>1960</strong> - Due to his great skill and talent, both as a driver and mechanical engineer, Miles was a significant member of the Shelby/Cobra race team </li>
            <li><strong>1963</strong> - He became the chief test driver of Shelby-American in 1963.</li>
            <li><strong>1965</strong> - he shared a Ford GT Mk II with Bruce McLaren at the 24 Hours of Le Mans but retired with gearbox trouble. Earlier in the year, also with McLaren, he had finished second at the 12 Hours of Sebring.
            </li>
            <li><strong>1966</strong> - he won the 24 Hours of Daytona, sharing the Ford GT Mk II with Lloyd Ruby, and then won the 12 Hours of Sebring. Several months later, sharing the drive with Denny Hulme, Miles was leading the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans in the #1 car, but Ford Motor Company executive Leo Beebe, desiring a publicity photo of three of Ford's cars crossing the finish line together, instructed Miles to slow down, which he did. Accordingly, on the final lap the next car from Ford driven by Bruce McLaren/Chris Amon and the third-place car from Ford drew up, and they cruised to the line together. The French race officials, after initially agreeing to Ford's dead-heat "photo-finish", reneged during the final hour of the race. Miles's #1 car and McLaren's #2 car crossed the finish line almost at the same time, with photos showing McLaren's #2 as slightly ahead when crossing the line. Additionally, McLaren's #2 started in second position behind Miles's car and had therefore covered 8 meters more distance during the race. Regardless of the reason, McLaren's #2 was declared the winner with Miles denied the unique achievement of winning Sebring, Daytona, and Le Mans in the same year.</li>
            <li><strong>1966</strong> - In August 1966, Shelby American resumed testing and development work with Miles as primary test driver. After almost a day of testing at Riverside International Raceway in the very hot Southern California desert, Miles approached the end of the track's one-mile (1.6 km) downhill back straight at top speed—over 200 miles per hour (320 km/h)—when the car suddenly flipped, crashed, and caught fire. The car broke into pieces and ejected Miles, killing him instantly. </li>

            <p> "I am a mechanic. That has been the direction of my entire vocational life. Driving is a hobby, a relaxation for me, like golfing is to others. I should like to drive a Formula One machine, not for the grand prize, but just to see what it is like. I should think it would be jolly good fun!
